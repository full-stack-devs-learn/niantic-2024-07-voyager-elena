Class: Rectangle

    Bug 1:
        Describe the bug/error:
        getArea returns wrong result for negative width

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        The bug was in the getArea function

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getArea_shouldReturnZero_withNegativeWidth()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        added condition statement to check if width is negative and returned 0 in this case

    Bug 2:
        Describe the bug/error:
        getArea returns wrong result for negative height

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        The bug was in the getArea function

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getArea_shouldReturnZero_withNegativeHeight()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        added condition statement to check if height is negative and returned 0 in this case

    Bug 3:

        Describe the bug/error:
        getPerimeter returns wrong perimeter when both width and height are positive

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        getPerimeter function, in return statement

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getPerimeter_shouldReturnCorrectPerimeter_whenSizesArePositive()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        added multiplying the expression in the return statement by 2




Class: Quiz

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        getPercent always returns 0

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        getPercent method, in the return statement, the formula had wrong order of operations and (score / possiblePoints) gives zero in integer division

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getPercent_shouldCalculatePercent()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        changed formula from score / possiblePoints * 100 to score  * 100 / possiblePoints

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        getLetterGrade returns B when score is 90 and possiblePoints = 100

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        getLetterGrade method, condition in the first if statement

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getLetterGrade_shouldReturnA_whenPercentIs90()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        replaced percent > 90 with percent >= 90 in the first if statement

    Bugs 3 and 4 are the same as 2 but for percent equals to 80 and 70 correspondingly
        Tests:
            getLetterGrade_shouldReturnB_whenPercentIs80() and
            getLetterGrade_shouldReturnC_whenPercentIs70()

    Bug 5:

        Describe the bug/error:
        getLetterGrade returns D when score is 54 and possiblePoints = 100

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        getLetterGrade method, condition in the last if statement

        What test helped you find the bug?
        getLetterGrade_shouldReturnF_whenPercentBetween50and60()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        replaced last if statement if(percent > 50) with if(percent >= 60)

Class: GameCharacter

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        takeHit sets energyLevel to negative number when damage is grater then the current energy level

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        takeHit method

        What test helped you find the bug?
        takeHit_shouldSetEnergyLevelToZero_whenDamageGreaterThanEnergyLevel()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        added conditional statement to check if damage is greater then current energy level and set energy level to 0 in that case

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        heal sets wrong energy level and it becomes greater than maxEnergyLevel
        The energyLevel should never increase above the maximum level

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        heal method

        What test helped you find the bug?
        heal_ShouldSetEnergyLevelToMaxEnergy_whenTheResultEnergyGreaterThanMaxEnergyLevel()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        added conditional statement to check if the result energy is greater than maxEnergyLevel
        and set energyLevel to maxEnergyLevel in this case

    Bug 3:

        Describe the bug/error:
        heal increases energy level when it is equals to zero
        But according to the requirements, the character with energyLevel = 0 is knocked out and cannot heal anymore

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        heal method

        What test helped you find the bug?
        heal_ShouldNotIncreaseEnergyLevel_whenEnergyLevelIsZero()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        added conditional statement to check if the character's energylevel = 0
        (or isKnockedOut is true) then do not increase energyLevel (used return)



Class: Printer

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        print method returns negative number when the amount of pages to be print is negative

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        print method

        What test helped you find the bug?
        print_shouldNotPrint_whenAmountOfCopiesIsNegative()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        added conditional statement to check if pages < 0, if so return 0

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        replaceToner does not set toner to MAX_TONER

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        replaceToner method

        What test helped you find the bug?
        replaceToner_shouldResetTonerToMaximumCapacity()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        replaced this.toner += MAX_TONER; with this.toner = MAX_TONER;
